## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Feel free to add more features to the app. I could've added likes, comments, etc. but I wanted to keep it simple.

I didn't have much time to work on this project as we are already working on a similar project, and this was just a rip-off of that project. Thank you!
